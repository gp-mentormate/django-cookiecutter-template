# The `constants.py` file serves as a centralized storage for
# constant values used across the application. It enables developers to
# define and manage various types of constants, such as configuration settings,
# error codes, or API endpoints, in one location. By using a constants.py file,
# code organization, readability, and reusability are improved, as it provides
# a single source of truth for these fixed values.

# Create yours constants here

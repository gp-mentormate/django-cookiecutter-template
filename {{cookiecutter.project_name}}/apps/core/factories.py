# The `factories.py` file, used with the factory-boy library in Django,
# allows developers to define and create factory functions or classes for
# generating test data. It provides a convenient way to generate realistic
# and customizable test objects, reducing the effort required for setting up
# test data during unit tests or automated testing.

# Create your factories here.

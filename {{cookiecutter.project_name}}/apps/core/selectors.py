# The `selectors.py` module contains the implementation of selectors,
# which are specialized components within an application that handle
# the logic of pulling information from the database. They act as a
# "sub-layer" to services, focusing on the retrieval of data rather
# than modifying it. Selectors encapsulate the queries and filtering
# operations necessary to retrieve specific data sets, making
# the database interaction more efficient and reusable across different
# parts of the application.

# Create your selectors here.
